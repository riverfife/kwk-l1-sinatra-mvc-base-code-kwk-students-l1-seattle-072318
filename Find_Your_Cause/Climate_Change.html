    <h3>Ways You Can Help From Home!</h3>
    
    <h4>Make Your Commute Greener!</h4>
    
    <p>Once a week, ride your bike to work/school instead of driving. Or you can take public transportation or even carpool. And while you're enjoying the fresh air and/or your friends company, you're also helping the environment, talk about a win-win!</p>
    
    <h4>Plant a Garden!</h4>
    
    <p>Planting a garden add much needed nutrients into the air, making it cleaner! This is because the plants will eat up the junk that floats around in our air. Below you will find a link to a website that will help you choose plants that will thrive in your environment. </p>

    <h4>Don't Waste Energy!</h4>
    
    <p>If you're not occupying a room, turn the light off. If the weather is decent outside, hang your washed clothes on a line instead of using enery to dry them. If it isn't too hot outside consider using a fan, instead of AC. All of these are simple ways you can save energy, and save the planet.</p>
    
    <h4>Reduce! Reuse! Recycle!</h4>
    
    <p>The first thing is pretty simple, don't waste. Use both sides of the paper and when it's all filled up, recycle it. Don't use plastic bags, use paper. They're stronger and much better for the environment. Buy products with minimal, reusable packaging. And recycle as much as you cna, so later it can be reused!</p>
